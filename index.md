      We recommend flying into Dublin airport, which is a 45 minute drive to the wedding. We’re thinking about organising a coach from Dublin depending on numbers, so please indicate on the RSVP form if you would be interested.</br></br>

      Yes, there are enough rooms on the estate for all of our guests to stay the night of the wedding, if they wish to, at a bed & breakfast rate of 210 euros per room. All of the rooms are temporarily being held for our guests, so please indicate on the RSVP form if you would like one so we can confirm how many rooms we will need with the venue.</br></br>

  - title: Can I stay at Tankardstown the night before the wedding (Friday)?
    answer: >
      The venue is currently holding all the rooms for a wedding the day before, so a room the night before can’t be guaranteed.
  - title: Can I stay at Tankardstown the night of the second day (Sunday)?
    answer: >
      Yes, rooms are available for all our guests the night after the wedding, if they wish to, at a rate of 180 euros per night. Please again indicate on the RSVP form if you would like one.
  - title: What is the plan for day two?
    answer: >
      We are planning a BBQ from noon to 5pm on the Sunday to give us a bit more time to celebrate with all our favourite people. It’s not compulsory but we would love to see as many of you as possible. The dress code is smart casual, for example chinos and a shirt for men and a day dress for women.
  - title: How do we get back to Dublin after the second day?
    answer: >
      We’re thinking about putting on a coach after the second day back to Dublin. Please indicate whether you would find this useful when you RSVP.
  - title: Are kids welcome?
    answer: >
      As much as we love children we are keeping our special day as an adult only occasion.
  - title: Gifts
    answer: >
      Your presence at our wedding is more than enough.
